# Hero RPG!

Hero RPG (heroRPG.py) is a python-based RPG to be run on the command line. It was created as part of DigitalCrafts training (June 2020 Cohort), and designed for the development of OOP skills.

### Requirements

- Python3 or later (built on Python3.8)
- all helper modules (characters, variables, etc)

### Similar projects

Two more similarly-designed games are available; [Zorklon5](https://github.com/dgelok/Zorklon5) and [Pyramid_Game](https://github.com/dgelok/pyramidGame). Pyramid Game also utilizes OOP principles, but Zorklon5 is more highly-developed.
